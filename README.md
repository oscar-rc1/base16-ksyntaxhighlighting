# Base16-KSyntaxHighlighting

[Base16 template](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) for generating [KSyntaxHighlighting](https://api.kde.org/frameworks/syntax-highlighting/html/) themes.

## Compatibility

The generated themes can be used in software based on [KTextEditor](https://api.kde.org/frameworks/ktexteditor/html/) like [Kate](https://kate-editor.org), [KDevelop](https://www.kdevelop.org/) and [Kile](https://apps.kde.org/en/kile), thanks to a [change](https://kate-editor.org/post/2020/2020-09-06-kate-color-themes/) introduced in KDE Frameworks version 5.75.

## Building the themes

This repository only provides the template for the theme files, a _generator_ is required for actually building the themes. See more details in the Base16 [repository](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) and [website](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/).
